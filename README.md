# Client File Mover

A simple .py file that huddles up files in a directory by extension and then moves them into sub-directories accordingly.

I had a client call me this morning and ask if I could refer a VA to them because they had over ten thousand different files in the downloads folder on their Windows Server and they needed someone to help itemize everything and then put them in sub-folders based on the type of file.

# I said I would do it for $100 bucks and crossed my fingers ðŸ’° ðŸ˜†

If you want to use the script do the following:

 - Clone the repo into the bloated directory
 - Make sure that your extensions are installed (If you run it python will tell you what is missing in the console)
 - Run the file and you should be good.
